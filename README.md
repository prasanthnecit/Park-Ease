# Park-Ease – Smart Parking Management System

## Project Problem Statement
In many parking environments, users face difficulty in identifying available parking slots due to the absence of a centralized and digital monitoring system. Manual or semi-automated parking management leads to inefficient space utilization, time consumption, and poor overall parking experience. A smart system is required to manage parking data securely and provide a scalable foundation for real-time slot monitoring.

## Milestone 1 – Description
Milestone 1 focuses on establishing the core backend foundation of the Park-Ease system. This milestone includes setting up the server-side architecture, database connectivity, and secure user authentication.

The following components are implemented in Milestone 1:
- Backend development using Node.js and Express.js
- MongoDB Atlas integration for data storage
- User authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- Basic REST API structure for user registration and login

This milestone serves as the base for implementing parking slot management and real-time features in subsequent phases.
